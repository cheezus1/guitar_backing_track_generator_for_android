The project aims to create an app for android phones which will generate
backing tracks for guitar for soloing. The app will choose the tracks
by the users preferences of key, mode, style, speed, length, etc. 
The program will be using fully pre-recodred backing tracks found on the Internet by us.
(Credits will be given to the original creators of the tracks!)
The user will also be able to records his playing over the track as well as
adding the track to a "favourites" list.
