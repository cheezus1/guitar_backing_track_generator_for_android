Guitar Backing Track Generator for Android

This is a school project craeted by Georgi Ivanov and Nedelcho Delchev,
students in 11 grade in the "Technological School of Electronic Systems"
in Sofia, Bulgaria, for the subject "Technology of Programing" with teacher
Kiril Mitov.

The project aims to create an app for android phones which will generate
backing tracks for guitar by combining guitar chords, 
thus enabling users to solo on top of them and record their soloing.

The program will (probably) have 3 modes:
1. Manual - in which the user will have to choose the guitar chords, 
length of track and it's speed all by themselves.

2. Semi-manual - in which the user will say in what key they would
like to play and the program will automaticly create the backing track
for them by combining guitar chords and choosing the length of the track
and it's speed.
The user will also be able to see the chords, length and speed before
palying the track.

3. Automatic(Random) - in which the app will generate a random backing track
in random key with random length and speed whitout the user inputing anything
The user will also be able to see the chords, length and speed before.
palying the track.
